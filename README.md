# Hands-on-Machine-Learning

This repo will be where I upload Jupyter notebooks as I follow along with the Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems by Aurelien Geron.

It also has Jupyter Notebooks with my own work and data sets I have analysed using techniques taught in the book.
